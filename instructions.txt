Goal for 2/25: Build as complete and complex a program as possible using an API

We have already explored the weather.gov API and know how to look up a location
by its latitude and longitude and return the forecast. With our new knowledge,
we are going to return to that program and refactor (or revise) it. 

This includes:
    *error handling for potential issues
    *incorporating other endpoints or APIs to make the process of finding a 
        forecast more reliable
    *packaging the program in functions to create a logical control flow
    *providing the best user experience you can achieve
    *adding visualizations using matplotlib 

I also recommend starting by visiualing outlining your program, to get a good sense
of the logical flow

If you finish revising our program with the above requirements, take what you've
built and adapt it to create a new program: one that alerts a user to weather 
alerts in their area. 

Hello Everyone!!!
